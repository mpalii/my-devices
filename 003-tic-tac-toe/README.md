# 003-tic-tac-toe

As a starting point for this project I picked the implementation of [Jim Heaney - Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/JimHeaney/tic-tac-toe-soldering-kit).  

Difference between Jim's and my versions:
- using the SMD components (mcu, leds, resistors, capacitors);  
- two selectable playing modes: player versus palyer, player versus algorithm.
